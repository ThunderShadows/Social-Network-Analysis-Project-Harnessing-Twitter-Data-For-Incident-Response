# Social-Network-Analysis-Project-Harnessing-Twitter-Data-For-Incident-Response
The project analyzes 8,562 disaster-related tweets to construct a hashtag co-occurrence network. We examine how disaster terminology interconnects, identify critical communication infrastructure, and uncover patterns in information flow during emergencies.

# Why This Project is Important
  Practical Importance:
        Emergency services need to know which hashtags to monitor
        Resource allocation during disasters depends on information flow
        Identifying bottlenecks prevents information loss

  Academic Importance:
        Advances understanding of crisis communication networks
        Applies SNA methods to real-world emergency scenarios
        Tests network theories in high-stakes contexts

  Socio-Economic Impact:
        Saves lives through better coordination
        Reduces economic losses from disasters
        Improves public safety infrastructure
        
# Actionable insights:
 "Based on network analysis, we recommend:
 
        Monitor Core Infrastructure: Priority monitoring of 12 core hashtags
        for misinformation. Establish verification protocols for high-betweenness
        nodes.

        Create Redundancy: Establish backup bridge hashtags to reduce
        dependency on #emergency. Promote alternative coordination terms.

        Cross-Disaster Integration: Facilitate connections between disaster
        type clusters through joint training exercises using shared vocabulary.

        Peripheral Monitoring: Implement automated monitoring for peripheral
        hashtags (degree < 3) to catch localized disasters early.

        Load Distribution: During major disasters, distribute communication
        across multiple hashtags to prevent core saturation."
